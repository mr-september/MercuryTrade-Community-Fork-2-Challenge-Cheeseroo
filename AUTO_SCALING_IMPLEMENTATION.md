# Auto-Scaling Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a simplified auto-scaling feature for MercuryTrade that shows recommended scaling values and provides easy one-click application.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Translation Keys
Added the following translation keys to `TranslationKey.java`:
- `auto_scaling` - "Auto-Scaling"
- `recommended_value` - "Recommended: %s"
- `set_to_recommended` - "Set to recommended"
- `current_value` - "Current: %s"

### 2. AutoScalingSettingsPanel Component
Created `AutoScalingSettingsPanel.java` with a clean, simple interface:

#### UI Components:
- **Three Synced Sliders**: Duplicate the existing notification, taskbar, and itemcell sliders
- **Current Value Display**: Shows current percentage for each slider
- **Recommendation Display**: Shows recommended values for each slider
- **"Set to Recommended" Buttons**: One-click apply recommendations for each slider
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes update immediately with live preview

#### Functionality:
- **Intelligent Recommendations**: Uses existing `ComponentsFactory.getScalingRecommendations()` system
- **Persistent Settings**: Integrates with `KeyValueConfigurationService` for persistence
- **Sync with Existing System**: Changes sync with existing manual scaling sliders
- **Configuration Management**: Full save/restore support

### 3. Integration with General Settings
- Added auto-scaling section to `GeneralSettingsPagePanel.java`
- Positioned between Vulkan support and taskbar settings
- Uses consistent styling and layout patterns

### 4. Placeholder Graphic
- Created placeholder file at `app-ui/src/main/resources/app/auto-scaling-graphic.png`
- Ready for actual graphic design implementation

## Simplified Design Philosophy

### Removed Complexity:
❌ ~~Enable/disable auto-scaling checkbox~~ - Not needed, it's just a helper tool
❌ ~~Detection mode selection~~ - Single monitor assumption, no need for "Basic/Advanced/Per-Monitor" 
❌ ~~Scaling status indicators~~ - User preference is king, no "suboptimal" warnings
❌ ~~Auto-apply on first boot~~ - Let users discover and choose when to use recommendations

### What Remains:
✅ Simple display of recommended values for current display
✅ Easy one-click buttons to apply recommendations
✅ Real-time preview of scaling changes
✅ Sync with existing manual scaling system
✅ Clean, uncluttered interface

## Technical Architecture

### Dependencies:
- Leverages existing `ComponentsFactory` for UI components
- Uses `ScalingLookupTable.ScalingRecommendation` for intelligent recommendations
- Integrates with `KeyValueConfigurationService<String, Float>` for persistence
- Connects to `MercuryStoreUI` subjects for real-time updates

### Key Methods:
- `updateRecommendations()`: Refreshes recommendation displays
- `applyConfiguration()`: Saves settings to persistent storage
- `restoreConfiguration()`: Loads settings from storage

## User Experience Features

### Core Functionality:
✅ Section under general settings page
✅ Duplicate of 3 existing sliders with sync
✅ Display of recommended values for each slider
✅ "Set to recommended" buttons for easy application
✅ Empty placeholder graphic file

### Design Benefits:
- Non-intrusive: Users can ignore if they prefer manual scaling
- Helpful: Shows what the system recommends for their display
- Simple: No complex modes or automatic behavior
- Respectful: No judgmental "suboptimal" messaging

## Files Modified/Created:

### Created:
- `app-ui/src/main/java/com/mercury/platform/ui/components/panel/settings/AutoScalingSettingsPanel.java`
- `app-ui/src/main/resources/app/auto-scaling-graphic.png` (placeholder)

### Modified:
- `app-core/src/main/java/com/mercury/platform/TranslationKey.java` (simplified translation keys)
- `app-ui/src/main/java/com/mercury/platform/ui/components/panel/settings/page/GeneralSettingsPagePanel.java` (added auto-scaling section)

## Implementation Notes:
The simplified design respects user autonomy while providing helpful guidance. Users see their current settings, see what's recommended, and can easily apply recommendations if they choose to. No automatic behavior, no judgmental messaging, just helpful information and easy actions.
